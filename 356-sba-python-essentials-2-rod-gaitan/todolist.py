'''
Task 2: Implement To-Do Manager Functions

Create a new module (e.g., todolist.py) that includes functions to manage tasks:
    - add_task(task_list, title, due_date=None): Creates a new Task and adds it to the list. If due_date is provided as a string, 
    parse it into a datetime.date (assume format “YYYY-MM-DD”). Use exception handling to catch parsing errors and inform the user.
    - complete_task(task_list, index): Marks the task at the given index as completed. If the index is invalid, handle the error 
    gracefully.
    - delete_task(task_list, index): Removes the task at the given index. Include error handling for invalid indices.
    - list_tasks(task_list): Returns or prints a formatted list of tasks showing index, status, title, and due date. Indicate if 
    a task is overdue by comparing the due date with today’s date.

The two directions look like this:
load_tasks builds objects. It reads a line of text from the file and creates a Task object from it (through add_task).
save_tasks flattens objects into text. task is a Task object that already exists in task_list. The writerow line pulls three 
values out of it (task.title, task.due_date, task.completed) and writes them as one line of text.
The writer object is the one thing that gets created, and that happened on the line before:

isinstance() is a built-in function, so you don’t need to import anything to use it.

It takes an object and a type (or a tuple of types) and returns True if the object is an instance of that type, False otherwise:
% 
isinstance("2026-11-20", str)   # True
isinstance(5, str)              # False
isinstance(5, (int, float))     # True (checks against either type)

You can see the full list of built-ins in the Python docs under “Built-in Functions.”

Note:  That last line in the output is the deleted task being printed, not an extra task. delete_task removes the task from the 
list and also returns it, and your print(delete_task(task_list, 0)) prints whatever gets returned. So you see the removed task 
one more time.

3)
Your output has 3 task lines at the top, so I see why it looks like index 2 should exist. But the first line doesn’t belong to task_list. I also made a mistake last time: I said an earlier delete had left only one task, and that wasn’t what happened in this run.

Here’s where each line comes from:

[-] Testing adding a task comes from print(add_task([], ...)). That call used a throwaway list, so it was never added to task_list.
[-] Testing adding a task is the first item in task_list (index 0).
[-] Task with no date is the second item in task_list (index 1).
[X] Testing adding a task comes from print(complete_task(task_list, 0)). It’s the same task as line 2, printed again, not a new item.

So task_list has only 2 tasks, at positions 0 and 1. Position 2 would be a third task, which doesn’t exist, so you get IndexError.

The tasks printed on lines 1 and 4 are repeats or belong to another list, so they don’t add positions to task_list.
